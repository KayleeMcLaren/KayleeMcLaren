# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaylee

I'm a Software Developer with 2 years of experience in the **fintech** space, passionate about building scalable, secure, and user-centric financial applications on the cloud.

Currently, I'm building a complete [**Serverless Fintech Ecosystem**](https://github.com/KayleeMcLaren/Serverless-Fintech-Ecosystem) from the ground up using AWS Serverless technologies. This portfolio is a collection of interconnected services that demonstrate core fintech functionalities, from digital wallets to payment processing and algorithmic debt optimization.

* **Phase 3: Personal & Advanced**
    * [ ] **Savings Goal Visualiser**: Customer-facing application logic.
    * [ ] **Debt Repayment Optimizer**: Algorithmic problem-solving.
