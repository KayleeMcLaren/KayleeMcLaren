# 👋 Hi, I'm Kaylee

I'm a Software Engineer passionate about building fintech systems that democratize access to financial services.

Currently, I work at AIMLScore, a South African fintech startup bringing digital financial services to underserved rural communities in Uganda. I've built production systems serving real users - from React dashboards for portfolio analysis to configuring cloud infrastructure with Terraform.

My [**Serverless Fintech Ecosystem**](https://github.com/KayleeMcLaren/Serverless-Fintech-Ecosystem) is my core portfolio project - a complete, event-driven platform built from scratch to demonstrate production-grade patterns: event choreography, atomic transactions, Step Functions orchestration, and comprehensive testing.
